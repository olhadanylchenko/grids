        <h1> fjords </h1>
        <h2>Fjords are found in locations where current or past glaciation extended below current sea level. A fjord is
            formed when a glacier retreats, after carving its typical U-shaped valley, and the sea fills the resulting
            valley floor.</h2>

        <p class="firstP">This forms a narrow, steep sided inlet (in Norway, sometimes deeper than 1300 metres)
            connected to
            the sea. The
            terminal moraine pushed down the valley by the glacier is left underwater at the fjord’s entrance, causing
            the
            water at the neck of the fjord to be shallower than the main body of the fjord behind it.</p>

        <p class="secondP">Fjord, from the norse “fjörðr”, means “der man ferder over” (English “where you travel
            across”)
            or “å sette over
            på den andre siden” (english “put across to the other side”).
            It has the same origin as the norwegian word “ferd” (english “fare” or “travel”). The verb “fare” (english
            “travel”) and the substantive “ferje” (english “ferry”) has the same origin. </p>
